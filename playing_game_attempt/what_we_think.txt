Strategy
------------------------------------------------
- Look at broken model:
	- what genes are "good" genes i.e. have at least 1 connection (best is both in connections are filled)
	- compare to actual data (rnaseq or mass spec)
- parameter estimation:
	- differential evolution (data_analysis.py)
	- only compare the good genes
	- some parameters seem to matter more than others 
		- d_p and d_m doesn't matter
		- leak rate controls the equalibrium position
- make some connections to match the experimental data (change_biotapestry.py)

- tried aggregating protein and mRNA data, but protein was too high --> terrible parameters
	- hone the protein parameters with mass spec data first

Notes
------------------------------------------------
Gene 8: DA
	rna-seq data matches with mRNA6 which is also DA
	Probably activated by 1 or 6

4,5,7: probably similar
	likely repressed (by 3?)
	7: repressed then ativated
	4: 
	3:


2,3: probably similar


GENE 7:
r 	r
7	1
7	6

GENE 4:
r 	r
2   6
